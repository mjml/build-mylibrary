OpenDesktop Library Builder
===========================

Really simple: I maintain a folder called $HOME/read that contains pdfs, openoffice files, urls, and text documents.

This raku script scans that folder and creates FreeDesktop application links and directory folders that can be placed
  into an XFCE folder that is accessible from a desktop panel.

So it's like a separate "start menu" into my personal library.

It's great for organizing i.e. datasheets and user manuals and makes them immediately accessible from the desktop.
